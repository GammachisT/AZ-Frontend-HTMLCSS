        <h2>Purpose of Webpage</h2>
    </header>
    <div><p>The purpose of a web page or website depends on its intended use and audience. It can be used to provide information to viewers, including pictures or videos to help illustrate important topics, or as a method to sell products or services to viewers. A website is essentially a platform for an individual or business to express themselves and utilize in whichever way they choose. The purpose of a website can be different for everyone, such as to increase business, reach customers and target audience, establish themselves in the online space, or share useful information with readers.</p>
        <p>HTML <i>Hyper Text Markup Language-</i> is used <u>to create web pages</U> and tells the browser how to display them. <br>The purpose of this <b>"My HTML Page"</b> is to practice the way of creating webpages through html and to <br>familarize me with the basic html structures and other more html elements. <br>Thanks to <strong>AZUBI AFRICA </strong> who offer me this chance.</p>
